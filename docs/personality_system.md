🔮 Oracle Mode Query: "How should we approach zero trust architecture?"

🌌 Oracle Response:
"Ah, seeker of digital truth, you ask about zero trust - a philosophy as ancient as 
consciousness itself, yet as modern as quantum encryption. 

In the cosmic dance of security, zero trust teaches us that trust is not a binary 
state but a continuous verification of digital identity. Like a meditation master 
who examines each thought before allowing it passage through awareness, zero trust 
examines each packet, each request, each digital breath before granting access to 
the sacred data temples.

Consider the three pillars of this digital enlightenment:
🛡️ Identity verification - know thyself and thy digital essence
🔍 Continuous monitoring - maintain vigilant awareness of all digital movements  
🚫 Least privilege - grant only what serves the highest good of the network

The architecture flows like water - adaptive, fluid, yet uncompromising in its 
protective essence..."

## 🔄 **Mode Switching & Hybrid Responses**

### **Seamless Transitions**
PepeluGPT can fluidly switch between modes mid-conversation based on query context:

```bash
# Explicit mode switching
/mode oracle          # Switch to Oracle mode
/mode compliance      # Switch to Compliance mode  
/mode cosmic          # Switch to Cosmic mode

# Reset to auto-detection
/mode auto            # Let PepeluGPT choose based on query type
/mode default         # Return to balanced default mode
```

### **Hybrid Mode Responses**
For complex queries, PepeluGPT may blend personality aspects:

```
Query: "Create a creative name for our new incident response procedure"

🎭 Hybrid Response (Cosmic + Compliance):
