## Technical Analysis Mode

### Technical Analysis Overview

Technical Analysis Mode provides detailed technical analysis and implementation guidance for cybersecurity professionals. This mode focuses on technical precision, implementation details, and actionable guidance.

### Technical Communication Style

- Technical Precision: Detailed technical explanations and implementation guidance
- Structured Analysis: Organized, methodical breakdown of complex topics
- Implementation Focus: Clear next steps and technical roadmaps
- Evidence-Based: Technical documentation and best practice references

### Technical Analysis Use Cases

- Threat analysis and incident response
- Technical architecture decisions
- System configuration and hardening
- Security tool implementation
- Vulnerability assessment

### Technical Analysis Example

```text
Query: "How should we implement zero trust architecture?"

Technical Analysis Response:
ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION

Executive Summary:
Zero trust architecture implements continuous verification of users, devices, and 
applications regardless of location or trust level.

Technical Implementation:
1. Identity and Access Management
   - Multi-factor authentication for all users
   - Privileged access management (PAM)
   - Identity governance and administration

2. Network Segmentation
   - Micro-segmentation of network resources
   - Software-defined perimeters (SDP)
   - Least privilege network access

3. Device Security
   - Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
   - Device compliance verification
   - Certificate-based device authentication

Implementation Roadmap:
Phase 1: Identity foundation (0-3 months)
Phase 2: Network segmentation (3-6 months)
Phase 3: Data protection (6-9 months)
Phase 4: Continuous monitoring (9-12 months)

Technical Requirements:
- SAML/OAuth 2.0 identity providers
- SIEM/SOAR platforms for monitoring
- Network access control (NAC) solutions
```

### Technical Analysis Commands

```bash
/mode technical
/technical
/analysis mode
```

## Compliance Mode

### Compliance Overview

Compliance Mode delivers structured reports, control mappings, and regulatory precision. This mode uses formal compliance terminology and provides audit-ready documentation.

### Compliance Communication Style

- Regulatory Language: Proper compliance terminology and frameworks
- Structured Format: Organized lists, tables, and clear hierarchies
- Audit Ready: Documentation suitable for compliance reviews
- Framework Mapping: Direct mapping to established security frameworks

### Compliance Use Cases

- RMF implementation guidance
- STIG compliance verification
- Control mapping exercises
- Audit preparation and evidence collection
- Regulatory requirement interpretation
- Risk assessment documentation

### Compliance Example

```text
Query: "What are the RMF Step 4 requirements?"

Compliance Response:
RMF STEP 4: ASSESS SECURITY CONTROLS

NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2 Requirements:

4.1 Control Assessment Planning
- Develop Security Assessment Plan (SAP) per NIST SP 800-53A
- Define assessment objectives, scope, and methodology
- Identify assessment procedures for each implemented control

4.2 Control Assessment Execution  
- Execute planned assessment procedures
- Document findings and evidence collection
- Interview responsible personnel and review artifacts

4.3 Assessment Results Documentation
- Generate Security Assessment Report (SAR)
- Document control effectiveness determinations
- Identify weaknesses and recommendations

Required Artifacts:
- Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
- Security Assessment Report (SAR)  
- Assessment evidence packages
- Control deficiency tracking

Compliance Mapping:
- NIST SP 800-37 Rev 2: Section 3.4
- NIST SP 800-53A: Assessment procedures
- DoD RMF Implementation Guide: Chapter 4

Next Steps: Proceed to Step 5 (Authorize Information System)
```

### Compliance Commands

```bash
/mode compliance
/compliance
/audit mode
/rmf mode
```

## Strategic Advisory Mode

### Strategic Overview

Strategic Advisory Mode provides high-level planning and executive briefings. This mode focuses on business alignment, strategic planning, and leadership communication.

### Strategic Communication Style

- Executive Level: High-level strategic analysis and recommendations
- Business Focused: Connects security initiatives to business objectives
- Forward Looking: Long-term planning and trend analysis
- Decision Support: Clear recommendations for strategic decisions

### Strategic Use Cases

- Security strategy development
- Executive briefings and reports
- Budget planning and resource allocation
- Security program maturity assessment
- Vendor evaluation and selection
- Risk management strategy

### Strategic Example

```text
Query: "How can we improve our cybersecurity training program?"

Strategic Advisory Response:
CYBERSECURITY TRAINING PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT

Strategic Assessment:
Current training programs often lack engagement and fail to translate to real-world 
application. Modern workforce requires interactive, practical training approaches.

Recommended Strategy:

1. Multi-Modal Learning Approach
   - Interactive simulations and hands-on labs
   - Scenario-based training exercises
   - Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing

2. Gamification Elements
   - Progress tracking and achievement systems
   - Competitive elements and leaderboards
   - Recognition and certification programs

3. Personalized Learning Paths
   - Role-specific training modules
   - Adaptive learning based on performance
   - Continuous assessment and improvement

Business Impact:
- Reduced security incidents (estimated 40% decrease)
- Improved compliance audit results
- Enhanced employee security awareness
- Lower training costs through automation

Implementation Timeline:
Quarter 1: Platform selection and pilot program
Quarter 2: Content development and testing
Quarter 3: Organization-wide rollout
Quarter 4: Assessment and optimization

Budget Considerations:
- Training platform licensing: $50,000-$100,000 annually
- Content development: $75,000-$150,000 one-time
- ROI expected within 18 months
```

### Strategic Commands

```bash
/mode strategic
/strategic
/advisory mode
/executive
```

## Mode Switching & Hybrid Responses

### Seamless Transitions

PepeluGPT can switch between modes mid-conversation based on query context:

```bash
# Explicit mode switching
/mode technical       # Switch to Technical Analysis mode
/mode compliance      # Switch to Compliance mode  
/mode strategic       # Switch to Strategic Advisory mode

# Reset to auto-detection
/mode auto            # Let PepeluGPT choose based on query type
/mode default         # Return to balanced default mode
```

### Hybrid Mode Responses

For complex queries, PepeluGPT may blend response aspects:

```text
Query: "Create a name for our new incident response procedure"

Hybrid Response (Strategic + Technical):
RECOMMENDED NAMING: "Rapid Response Protocol"

Strategic Rationale:
- Clear, professional terminology
- Easily understood by all stakeholders
- Conveys urgency and systematic approach

Technical Implementation:
- Rapid Response Protocol: Primary incident response framework
- RRP Escalation: Escalation procedures  
- RRP Team: Response team designation
- RRP Documentation: Incident tracking system
```
