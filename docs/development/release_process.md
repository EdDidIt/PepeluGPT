echo "ï¿½ EMERGENCY ROLLBACK INITIATED"
echo "Restoring previous stable state..."

# 1. Identify last stable version
LAST_STABLE=$(git tag --sort=-version:refname | grep -v "$(git describe --tags)" | head -1)

# 2. Rollback deployment
./scripts/deploy-production.sh $LAST_STABLE --emergency

# 3. Verify rollback success
./scripts/verify_production_deployment.py --emergency-check
