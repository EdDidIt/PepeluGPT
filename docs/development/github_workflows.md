        # Deploy to production environment
        ./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

### Rollback Procedures

        ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh
        
    - name: Alert Operations Team
      uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
      with:
        status: failure
        text: "Emergency rollback activated - operations team attention required!"
```

## Workflow Monitoring

### Health Checks

```yaml
health-check:
  name: System Health Check
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Check Oracle Mode Health
      run: curl -f https://api.pepelugpt.com/health/oracle
      
    - name: Check Compliance Mode Health  
      run: curl -f https://api.pepelugpt.com/health/compliance
      
    - name: Check Professional Mode Health
      run: curl -f https://api.pepelugpt.com/health/professional
```

### Performance Monitoring

```yaml
- name: Performance Metrics
  run: |
    # Response time monitoring
    curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -s -o /dev/null https://api.pepelugpt.com/
    
    # Memory usage tracking
    ps aux | grep pepelugpt | awk '{print $6}' | head -1
    
    # Disk usage monitoring
    df -h | grep pepelugpt
```

## Best Practices

### Professional Workflow Guidelines

1. **Clear Purpose**: Every workflow should have clear purpose and objectives
2. **Compliance Standards**: All workflows must include security and quality checks
3. **Professional Flow**: Workflows should be readable, maintainable, and well-documented
4. **Security First**: Security scanning and validation in every pipeline
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular workflow optimization and enhancement

### Performance Optimization

- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent jobs simultaneously
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache dependencies and build artifacts
- **Conditional Logic**: Skip unnecessary steps based on changes
- **Resource Management**: Optimize runner selection and resource allocation
